A simple mixin called Animatable is provided. What does it do?
It makes CSS transitions for you, and if they aren't available,
implements them in JavaScript.

Current good things:
	- Seems to work!
	- Animates 300 SC.LabelViews acceptably with only JavaScript. Animates >500
	  just as well (if not better) with CSS transitions.
	- Automatically detects if CSS transitions are available.
	
Current flaws:
	- Likely somewhat buggy. Haven't seen any bugs, though... Please tell me.
	- Not very configurable. Should at LEAST allow (preset) interpolation
	  functions.
	- No support for changing non-layout properties such as color.
	
Example Usage:

	aView: SC.LabelView.design(Animate.Animatable, {
		transitionLayout: {
			left: {duration: 250},
			top: {duration: 250}
		}
	})
