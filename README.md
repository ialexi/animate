NOTE: API HAS CHANGED.

A simple mixin called Animatable is provided. What does it do?
It makes CSS transitions for you, and if they aren't available,
implements them in JavaScript.

Current good things:
* Seems to work!
* Animates 300 SC.LabelViews acceptably with only JavaScript. Animates >500
  just as well (if not better) with CSS transitions.
* Automatically detects if CSS transitions are available.
	
Current flaws:
* Supports only a limited subset of properties. For instance, no support for
  animating background colors.
	
Example Usage:

		aView: SC.LabelView.design(Animate.Animatable, {
			transitions: {
				left: .25,
				top: {duration: .25},
				width: { duration: .25, timing: Animate.TIMING_EASE_IN_OUT }, // with timing curve
				height: { duration: .5, timing: [0, 0, 0.58, 1.0] } // with custom timing curve
			}
		})

Including in your SproutCore Project
===============================================================================
First, if you know what you are doing, or just want to hack it, you can just
take the one (and only) code file, core.js, rename it, put it somewhere, whatever.
Though that won't keep you up-to-date with any improvements...


Getting the Code Using git:
* Navigate to your SproutCore project folder (the one that contains apps/, under 
  which your application is located).

* git clone git://github.com/ialexi/animate.git

Getting the Code through GitHub:
Go to http://github.com/ialexi/animate and select download. Download in whichever
format you prefer.

Navigate to your SproutCore project folder; if there is no subfolder "frameworks",
create one. Under the "frameworks" folder, create a folder "animate".

Place the files that were extracted (not the containing folder) into the "animate"
folder you created.


Installing
===============================================================================
In your project-level Buildfile, there is a line like this:
config :all, :required => :sproutcore

Add the animate framework to it by changing it to this:
config :all, :required => [:sproutcore, :animate]

Now, you should be able to use it in any view, as demonstrated above!


Reference
===============================================================================
The API is simple. You set up transitions in the "transitions" property, and can
supply them with a few parameters:
* duration: The amount of time in seconds that the animation should last.
* timing:   The timing curve to use. Defaults to Animate.defaultTimingFunction. See "Timing"


Timing
------
Timing is handled using bezi√©r curves (like in CSS transitions).

The variable Animate.defaultTimingFunction can be used to globally set the timing
curve; any transition that has "null" as its timing curve will use this default
timing curve.

For example, you could include this line in one of your JavaScript files:
Animate.defaultTimingFunction = Animate.TRANSITION_EASE_IN_OUT;

There are a few built-in timing curves (shown here with their values). The curves
with CSS in their name are CSS-only versions; JavaScript-based animations will use
linear. The big benefit of CSS-only timing functions is that JavaScript performance
is not impacted; to handle timing curves, JavaScript has to do some semi-heavy calculations
**each frame**. Using CSS-only transitions gives a graceful degradation of sorts.

* Animate.TRANSITION_NONE: "linear"
* Animate.TRANSITION_CSS_EASE: "ease"
* Animate.TRANSITION_CSS_EASE_IN: "ease-in"
* Animate.TRANSITION_CSS_EASE_OUT: "ease-out"
* Animate.TRANSITION_CSS_EASE_OUT: "ease-in-out"
* Animate.TRANSITION_EASE: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0]
* Animate.TRANSITION_LINEAR: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
* Animate.TRANSITION_EASE_IN: [0.42, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
* Animate.TRANSITION_EASE_OUT: [0, 0, 0.58, 1.0]
* Animate.TRANSITION_EASE_IN_OUT: [0.42, 0, 0.58, 1.0]


**Note**: The TRANSITION_NONE value is technically a CSS-only "linear" curve; as CSS-only
curves make JavaScript use linear, it all works out.
